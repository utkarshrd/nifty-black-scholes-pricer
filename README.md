# NIFTY Black-Scholes Option Pricer

This project is a complete Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook. It is specifically tailored to price European options on the NIFTY 50 index, a common task for quantitative finance roles in the Indian market.

The model calculates theoretical call and put prices, along with their associated risk metrics (the "Greeks"), based on a set of standard market inputs.

## Core Features

- **Black-Scholes Model**: Implements the core BSM formulas for call and put options.
- **Greeks Calculation**: Computes Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta for comprehensive risk analysis.
- **Batch Processing**: Prices a wide range of strikes and expiries simultaneously.
- **Professional Visualizations**: Generates a suite of plots to analyze option characteristics, including:
    - Price vs. Strike Curves
    - Delta vs. Strike Profiles
    - A 3D Vega Surface (Volatility vs. Time)
    - Model Price vs. Hypothetical Market Price Comparison
- **Data Export**: Saves all calculated prices and Greeks to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Results Showcase

### Option Prices & Greeks Table
A snapshot of the primary output, showing calculated prices and Greeks for various NIFTY 50 options.

*(A table generated by the notebook will be displayed here)*

### Price vs. Strike Curve
This plot shows the classic "hockey stick" payoff structure for call and put options at a specific expiry.

### Delta vs. Strike
This plot illustrates how the option's delta changes as the underlying's price moves across different strikes. At-the-money (ATM) options have a delta near 0.5.

### 3D Vega Surface
This surface visualizes how Vega (sensitivity to volatility) changes across different times to expiry and volatility levels. Vega is highest for at-the-money options with longer expiries.

### Model vs. Market Price Comparison
A bar chart comparing the Black-Scholes model's theoretical price against hypothetical market prices, useful for identifying potential mispricings.
